HNT mining is becoming popular but getting your hands on the hardware is very tough with often a large back log of upto 1 year. HNT mining is the process of mining via LoraWAN signals. LoraWAN has a high range of upto 10 miles or more that makes it perfect for talking with IOT devices that are restricted to typical wireless or bluetooth communications.
