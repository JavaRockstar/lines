### Disclaimer

I am creating these mining guides for your convince non of the information written in these guides should be taken as financial advise. We won't tell you what coin to mine as you need to make this choice for yourself. We aim to provide you with some of the best infomation to help you start mining cryptocurrency.

### Features

Our site is based on a simplistic theme called Lines that is written in HTML and SCSS. Pages are wrote in Markdown language they are easy to edit and look great. I have seen some really good sites overtime that have a wealth of information but look so simplistic in design. Since we are trying to keep our website as clean and simple to use as possible we figured what better then an index of the best infomation to help you learn to mine Cryptocurrencies.
